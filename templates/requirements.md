# Requirements Template

Template for `.plano/REQUIREMENTS.md` -- checkable requirements that define "done."

# Requirements: [Project Name]

**Defined:** [date]
**Core Value:** [from PROJECT.md]

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Authentication

- [ ] **AUTH-01**: User can sign up with email and password
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: User receives email verification after signup
- [ ] **AUTH-03**: User can reset password via email link
- [ ] **AUTH-04**: User session persists across browser refresh

### [Category 2]

- [ ] **[CAT]-01**: [Requirement description]
- [ ] **[CAT]-02**: [Requirement description]
- [ ] **[CAT]-03**: [Requirement description]

### [Category 3]

- [ ] **[CAT]-01**: [Requirement description]
- [ ] **[CAT]-02**: [Requirement description]

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### [Category]

- **[CAT]-01**: [Requirement description]
- **[CAT]-02**: [Requirement description]

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| [Feature] | [Why excluded] |
| [Feature] | [Why excluded] |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| AUTH-01 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| AUTH-02 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| AUTH-03 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| AUTH-04 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| [REQ-ID] | Phase [N] | Pending |

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: [X] total
- Mapped to phases: [Y]
- Unmapped: [Z]

**Requirement Format:**
- ID: `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, CONTENT-02, SOCIAL-03)
- Description: User-centric, testable, atomic
- Checkbox: Only for v1 requirements (v2 are not yet actionable)

**Categories:**
- Derive from project domain
- Keep consistent with domain conventions
- Typical: Authentication, Content, Social, Notifications, Moderation, Payments, Admin

**v1 vs v2:**
- v1: Committed scope, will be in roadmap phases
- v2: Acknowledged but deferred, not in current roadmap
- Moving v2 to v1 requires roadmap update

**Out of Scope:**
- Explicit exclusions with reasoning
- Prevents "why didn't you include X?" later

**Traceability:**
- Empty initially, populated during roadmap creation
- Each requirement maps to exactly one phase
- Unmapped requirements = roadmap gap

**Status Values:**
- Pending: Not started
- In Progress: Phase is active
- Complete: Requirement verified
- Blocked: Waiting on external factor

</guidelines>

<evolution>

**After each phase completes:**
1. Mark covered requirements as Complete
2. Update traceability status
3. Note any requirements that changed scope

**After roadmap updates:**
1. Verify all v1 requirements still mapped
2. Add new requirements if scope expanded
3. Move requirements to v2/out of scope if descoped

**Requirement completion criteria:**
- Requirement is "Complete" when:
  - Feature is implemented
  - Feature is verified (tests pass, manual check done)
  - Feature is committed
